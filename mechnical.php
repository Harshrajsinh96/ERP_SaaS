              <h1>Mechanical Engineering </h1>
              <p align="justify">Mechanical engineering is the Basic branch of engineering. It is also referred to as the 'mother' branch of engineering. Mechanical engineering is a discipline that applies the principles of engineering, physics and materials science for analysis, design, manufacturing, and maintenance of mechanical systems. It is one of the oldest and broadest engineering disciplines.
              Mechanical engineering is a diverse subject that derives its breadth from the need to design and manufacture everything from small needle to a big Aeroplane. </p>
              <p>
Traditionally, mechanical engineers have to deal with concepts such as mechanics, thermodynamics, robotics, kinematics, structural analysis, fluid mechanics, CAD/CAM, Automations and many others. Mechanical engineers also contribute in the development of various engines, power plant equipment, heating and cooling systems and other simple and complex machinery.

</p>
<p>
Mechanical engineering branch was started in AIT in 2004 with 60 student's intake,
now the current scenario is:<br/>
Ist shift- 120 students<br/>
2nd Shift-120 Students<br/>
UG- 60 Students<br/>
