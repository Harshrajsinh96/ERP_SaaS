               <h1>Electrical Engineering</h1>
<p align="justify">   To sustain the planned growth in the power sector, the industry needs human resources skilled in electrical engineering. The Electrical Engineering Department is contributing to this need by producing trained technology leaders. Department of Electrical Engineering came into existence in July 2004 with intake of 60 students. The department has a goal of providing excellence in technical education. The department has well-qualified, experienced & dedicated faculty members. The department provides opportunities to the students to work in state of the art laboratories like Basic Electrical Engineering, Electrical Machines, Power System Protection, PLC & Microprocessor, Control Systems & Instrumentation. All the laboratories are equipped with most modern equipments and instruments. The department also provides facilities for computer simulation and virtual experimentation with the latest updated software like MATLAB, PSIM Mi-Power, Auto CAD-Electrical etc. The final year students are provided all infrastructural facilities needed to carry out their projects to explore the advanced technological boom. All the faculty members' posses' Master's degree in the various specialized fields of electrical engineering. Few of them are also pursuing their PhDs from India's premier technical institutions like NIT & IITs.
