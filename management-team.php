        Education Policy declared by Government of India in 1986 and passing of A.I.C.T.E. Act in 1987 by both the houses of Parliament paved way for starting Self Financed Institutions of Technical Education in the country. In subsequent years, globalization of Trade and Industry and liberalization of economy in the country inculcated aspirations among the parents and students to go for higher technical education for their bright future. As such, the thirst for technical education in every corner of society went on increasing year after year. In course of time, knowledge became the source of generating of wealth and graduates of Engineering colleges became high in demand nationally and internationally where they are known as Knowledge workers. In order to ensure Gujarat does not lag behind other states in matter of quality technical education to its youth; few highly educated and like minded persons came forward to fulfill this Herculean task by forming Charitable trust known as Ashok Landmark Education Trust which created an Institution named as “Ahmedabad Institute of Technology”. This Institute was established with objective to provide quality Technical Education to the youth of Gujarat and to fulfill the aspirations of the students and their parents in today’s knowledge based society. As such, Ahmedabad Institute of Technology was established in June 2004 under the ageis of The Ashok Education Land Mark Trust with the approval of All India Council for Technical Education to fulfill technical educational needs of the students of Gujarat State. It has gained name for imparting quality technical education in the vicinity of Ahmedabad offering Degree programmes in 4 branches of Engineering viz Electronics & Communication Engg, Electrical Engg., Computer Engg and Mechanical Engg. wherein branch of Information Technology & Post Graduate Programme in Management were added in 2008.
