          Education Policy declared by Government of India in 1986 and passing of A.I.C.T.E. Act in 1987 by both the houses of Parliament paved way for starting Self Financed Institutions of Technical Education in the country. In subsequent years, globalization of Trade and Industry and liberalization of economy inculcated aspirations among the parents and students to go for higher technical education for their bright future. As such, the thirst for technical education in every sphere of society went on increasing year after year. In course of time, knowledge became the source of generating the wealth and graduates of Engineering colleges became in high demand nationally and internationally where they are known as Knowledge workers.In order to ensure that Gujarat does not lag behind other states in matter of imparting quality technical education to its youth; few highly educated and like minded persons came forward to fulfill this Herculean task by forming Charitable trust known Ashok Landmark Education Trust which created an Institution named  “Ahmedabad Institute of Technology”. This Institute was established with objective to provide quality Technical Education to the youth of Gujarat and to fulfill the aspirations of the students and their parents in today’s knowledge based society. As such, Ahmedabad Institute of Technology was established in June 2004 under the approval of All India Council for Technical Education to fulfill technical educational needs of the students of Gujarat State. It has gained  name for imparting quality technical education in the vicinity of Ahmedabad. Currently it offers Degree programmes in five branches of Engineering viz Electronics & Communication Engg, Electrical Engg., Computer Engg. Mechanical Engg. and Information Technology along with Post Graduate Programme in Management. Few more branches of Engineering and M. C, A. programme are proposed to be added to the existing list of Educational Programmes so that it can fulfill the needs and aspirations of the students while the institute becomes the hub of  quality technical education in Gujarat.
